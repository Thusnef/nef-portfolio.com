                <h2>Ant Dodge Game</h2>
                <p>This Python program utilizes Pygame to create a game called "Ant Dodge." It sets up a window, loads images for the player (an ant) and rain, and implements game mechanics.<br>
                    <br>The player moves with arrow keys, avoiding falling stars while collecting points. The game tracks time, updating the score as the elapsed time.<br>
                    <br>Upon collision with a rain, it displays the score and offers a "Play Again" button. Overall, it's a simple yet engaging game centered around avoiding obstacles and aiming for a high score.</p>
